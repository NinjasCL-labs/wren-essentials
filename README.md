# wren-essentials

See:

https://github.com/wren-lang/wren-cli/issues/52

### TODOS

- [ ] Clean up premake borrowed from Wren-CLI
- [ ] Generate the module registry dynamically from analyzing the module source
- [ ] get the registry headers into wren-cli so we can make it a dependency (right now they are copied into `essentials.h`)
